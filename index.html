                <li>I recently completed the Linux 101 course, an introductory program designed to equip beginners with fundamental

                     the world of cybersecurity and ethical hacking. The course covered a wide array of topics that included network scanning,
                      vulnerability analysis, 
                    exploitation techniques, and post-exploitation activities,
